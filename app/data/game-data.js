    Intro: "**[H]uman** nature is represented in the witnesses, the counsel, and the jurors. All three, in their weaknesses, have been kept in mind by the law of evidence. The multifold untrustworthinesses of witnesses; the constant partisan zeal, the lurking chicanery, the needless unpreparedness of counsel; the crude reasoning, the strong irrational emotions, the testimonial inexperience of jurors – all these elements have been considered [by the law of evidence and procedure]. In responding to this observation by Wigmore of the influence of ‘human nature’ on the shaping of rules of evidence and procedure, consider whether ‘multifold untrustworthinesses of [a witness]’, ‘partisan zeal’ etc. of counsel applied in your court observations. For example, did counsel seek to rely on the possibility the jury would engage in ‘crude reasoning’? Was a witness assumed to be untrustworthy (correctly or incorrectly)? Crucially, how did any of the assumptions (present or absent) operate with respect to the rules of evidence and procedure and the goals of the trial?",

    Forward: "\u201CHuman nature is represented in the witnesses, the counsel, and the jurors. All three, in their weaknesses, have been kept in mind by the law of evidence. The multifold untrustworthinesses of witnesses; the constant partisan zeal, the lurking chicanery, the needless unpreparedness of counsel; the crude reasoning, the strong irrational emotions, the testimonial inexperience of jurors \u2013 all these elements have been considered by the law of evidence and procedure\u201D\r\n-Wigmore in The Treatise (3rd edition, 8c at 262)\r\nIn practice, whether the laws of evidence sufficiently guard against human fallibility is open to question. This is particularly true in the adversarial system in which people are pitted against one another in all their manifold weaknesses. The presence of the jury allows for a performative style of argument that brings qualitative analysis into play. The dangers this presents to a fair trial are checked only by the extent to which a judge can rein in a trial based on the statutory scheme governing the admissibility of evidence.\r\nIn this game, you will be required to assume the role of the judge. You will be given a number of scenarios, based on real court observations. You will then be required to assess the admissibility of what you observe in each. You will be required to base your reasoning on the Australian Uniform Evidence Act. \r\nWhen you have completed all your scenarios you will be given a score as to how well you did. Good luck your honour!"
