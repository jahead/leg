All three, in their weaknesses, have been kept in mind by the law of evidence. The multifold untrustworthinesses of witnesses; the constant partisan zeal, the lurking chicanery, the needless unpreparedness of counsel; the crude reasoning, the strong irrational emotions, the testimonial inexperience of jurors \\u2013 all these elements have been considered by the law of evidence and procedure\\u201D\\r\\n-Wigmore in The Treatise (3rd edition, 8c at 262)\\r\\nIn practice, whether the laws of evidence sufficiently guard against human fallibility is open to question. This is particularly true in the adversarial system in which people are pitted against one another in all their manifold weaknesses. The presence of the jury allows for a performative style of argument that brings qualitative analysis into play. The dangers this presents to a fair trial are checked only by the extent to which a judge can rein in a trial based on the statutory scheme governing the admissibility of evidence.\\r\\nIn this game, you will be required to assume the role of the judge.
